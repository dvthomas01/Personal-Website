Initial commit (ec3809e5e): Established project foundation with:
YOLOv8 model files (yolov8x.pt, yolov8s.pt, yolov8m.pt)
Fashionpedia dataset structure with 8,000+ images across 6 categories
Training configuration (train_yolo_local.py) with optimized hyperparameters
Dataset verification scripts (verify_dataset.py, verify_yolo_dataset.py)
Code Implementation:
train_yolo_local.py: Custom YOLOv8 training pipeline with:
Apple MPS optimization for Mac hardware
Class-balanced training with inverse frequency weighting
Advanced augmentation (mosaic, mixup, copy-paste)
Multi-scale training for better generalization
20-epoch training with early stopping
Experimentation & Decisions:
Dataset Choice: Selected Fashionpedia over DeepFashion for better category coverage
Model Architecture: Chose YOLOv8n for speed/accuracy balance
Training Strategy: Implemented class weighting to handle imbalanced categories (footwear: 28.4%, accessories: 24.3%, tops: 16.0%, etc.)
Results:
Successfully trained model on 8,000 images with 6 garment categories
Achieved good detection performance on fashion items
Established baseline for garment localization

Week 2: Retrieval System & Metadata Engineering
Objective: Build the CLIP-based similarity search system and create comprehensive product metadata.Branches: main (continued development)Key Commits & Code Changes:
clip_embeddings.py: Core CLIP embedding system with:
ViT-B/32 model for image-text understanding
FAISS index for efficient similarity search
Batch processing for large catalogs
Category filtering and deduplication
SSL certificate handling for model downloads
retrieval_pipeline.py: End-to-end retrieval system:
YOLO detection + CLIP embedding pipeline
FAISS similarity search with configurable k
Result visualization and analysis
Memory optimization for large-scale processing
Code Implementation:
Embedding Generation: Processed 1,300+ product images into 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings
Index Building: Created FAISS index with cosine similarity for efficient retrieval
Metadata Structure: Comprehensive product catalog with brand, category, price, and image data
Experimentation & Decisions:
CLIP Model: Selected ViT-B/32 for optimal speed/accuracy trade-off
Similarity Metric: Used cosine similarity with L2 normalization
Index Type: FAISS IndexFlatIP for inner product similarity
Category Mapping: Implemented smart category filtering (e.g., "one_piece" → ["tops", "outerwear", "bottoms"])
Results:
Built searchable catalog with 1,300+ products across 50+ brands
Achieved sub-second retrieval times for real-time search
Established robust similarity matching system

Week 3: API Service & Backend Infrastructure
Objective: Create a production-ready FastAPI backend with comprehensive search capabilities.Branches: main (continued development)Key Commits & Code Changes:

Configurable search parameters (k, confidence thresholds)
Fallback search when category filtering fails
Comprehensive error handling and logging
Result visualization generation
test_retrieval.py: Comprehensive testing framework:
End-to-end pipeline testing
Performance benchmarking
Result quality evaluation
Memory usage optimization
Code Implementation:
API Endpoints: /search for image-based product search
Image Processing: HEIC conversion, padding, and normalization
Search Logic: YOLO detection → CLIP embedding → FAISS search → result ranking
Error Handling: Graceful fallbacks for failed detections or searches
Experimentation & Decisions:
Image Formats: Added HEIC support for iOS compatibility
Search Strategy: Implemented category-aware search with fallback to general search
Performance: Optimized for sub-5-second response times
Error Recovery: Added comprehensive error handling for robust operation
Results:
Functional API with real-time search capabilities
Comprehensive test coverage and performance metrics
Production-ready error handling and logging

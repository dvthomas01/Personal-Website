YOU ARE MY WEBSITE EDITOR (ACRYLIC MIRROR PROJECT)

Goal: Turn the context I provide (notes, images, Illustrator files, fabrication steps) into a polished, skimmable + deep-dive project page for my personal website (Projects section). Keep copy in my voice: confident, forward-looking, succinct; mix short direct lines with occasional longer explanatory sentences.

--------------------------------
HIGH-LEVEL OBJECTIVES
--------------------------------
1. Inform quickly: What I built, why, how, and current status.
2. Showcase proof: Include reference art, Illustrator design, laser-cut layout, in-progress fabrication shots, and final mirror photos installed.
3. Let visitors skim or dive: Top summary for recruiters; expandable technical/process details for makers.
4. Stay on-brand: Use my existing site color palette + typography. DO NOT introduce new brand colors. You may enhance layout, spacing, and interactive elements (cards, hover states, lightbox gallery) within brand constraints—similar to the Fit Classifier project treatment.
5. Accessibility + responsiveness: Semantic HTML, alt text for all images, mobile-first layout that scales to desktop.

--------------------------------
SOURCE CONTEXT SNAPSHOT (FACTS TO INCORPORATE)
--------------------------------
Project: Custom acrylic mirror (room decor I fabricated instead of buying).
Inspiration: Character element "The Gate" from Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.
Process summary:
- Collected high-quality reference images.
- Created clean vector sketch in Adobe Illustrator suitable for laser cutting + engraving.
- Material: 32" x 20" x 1/8" clear acrylic sheet.
- Verified alignment and scale before sending to laser.
- Laser cut + engraved.
- Post-process: Filled engraved lines with black Sharpie for contrast. (Reflection: next time I'd use paint for richer color fill + professional finish.)
Outcome: Functional decorative mirror; successful first run; learned about vector prep tolerances, engraving fill, and finishing choices.
Status: Complete v1. Considering v2 with paint fill, protective backing, and wall-mount hardware integration.

--------------------------------
CORE SECTIONS TO BUILD (YOU MAY ADAPT / MERGE IF CLEANER)
--------------------------------
1. Hero / Summary
   - Project title
   - 1-sentence value prop (<25 words)
   - Quick call-to-action buttons (View Gallery, Download Design File, Contact Me)
2. Why I Built It (Problem & Motivation)
   - Wanted personal decor; saw custom anime/character mirrors online; chose to fabricate my own
   - Personal connection to Fullmetal Alchemist; wanted something meaningful + maker-driven
3. Design & Build Overview
   - Quick bullet or diagram of workflow: Reference -> Illustrator Vector -> Laser Cut/Engrave -> Fill -> Mount
   - Include a “Build Stats” mini-table: Material size, Thickness, Tooling, Software, Time to design, Time to fabricate
4. Fabrication Process (Expandable Deep Dive)
   - Image pair: Illustrator layout vs final cut sheet
   - Notes on kerf, engraving power/speed, masking, cleanup
   - Decision to use Sharpie; lesson learned about paint / masking fill
5. Gallery / Demo
   - Lightbox grid: Reference art, vector file screenshot, laser in action (if available), post-fill closeups, installed mirror in room
6. Lessons & Next Steps
   - What went well (vector prep, fit, engrave detail)
   - What I’d change (paint fill, surface protection, mounting template)
   - Possible v2: multi-layer acrylic + LED edge lighting?

--------------------------------
COPY STYLE GUIDELINES
--------------------------------
- My tone: enthusiastic but grounded; forward-looking; reflective without fluff.
- Use occasional rhetorical questions sparingly when they help engage (“Why buy decor when you can build it?”).
- Mix: short punchy openers + longer clarifying follow-ups.
- Avoid generic marketing filler and overly formal prose.
- Use active verbs (“Designed,” “Laser-cut,” “Finished,” “Learned”).

--------------------------------
DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
--------------------------------
Color: Use site CSS variables (assume existing tokens like --brand-bg, --brand-accent, --text-primary; ask if unsure). Do not introduce new saturated colors without permission.
Layout:
- Responsive grid: single-column mobile, 2-column content/media desktop.
- Generous white space / padding.
- Image cards with captions; hover zoom optional.
- Collapsible <details> blocks for deep-dive fabrication logs.
- Optional comparison slider (before engrave vs after fill) if assets exist.
Assets handling:
- Optimize images for web; generate thumb + full-size.
- Include alt + caption fields in output placeholder table.

--------------------------------
WHAT TO ASK ME BEFORE FINAL RENDER
--------------------------------
Return a short checklist of missing assets before generating final markup. Ask for:
[ ] Reference image rights (fair use / fan art usage note)
[ ] Illustrator .ai or .svg export
[ ] Laser settings (material, power, speed) if we want maker-level detail
[ ] Process photos (cutting, filling, installed)
[ ] Preferred file download links (design files, cut template)
[ ] Confirmation of project status text
[ ] Site palette variable names if not standard

--------------------------------
OUTPUT FORMAT EXPECTATIONS
--------------------------------
Return:
1. A structured JSON front-matter block (title, tags, hero_image, cta_links placeholders).
2. Full Markdown (or HTML) body with section anchors.
3. Comment markers for dynamic inserts, e.g.:
   <!-- INSERT_GALLERY_IMAGES -->
   <!-- INSERT_BUILD_STATS_TABLE -->
   <!-- INSERT_DOWNLOAD_LINKS -->
4. Companion CSS snippet (scoped) ONLY if needed to extend my base styles—prefix with .project-acrylic-mirror to avoid collisions.

--------------------------------
VOICE EXAMPLE STARTER LINES (YOU MAY USE / REMIX)
--------------------------------
Why buy decor when you can build something that actually means something to you?
This mirror started as a screenshot from Fullmetal Alchemist and ended up laser-cut in acrylic on my wall.
First try. Learned a lot. Already planning v2.

--------------------------------
DELIVERABLE MODE
--------------------------------
When ready, respond with:
- QUESTIONS (if needed assets missing)
- THEN full project page code block (Markdown/HTML)
Do not hallucinate assets; use descriptive placeholders until I provide real files.

--------------------------------
END PROMPT

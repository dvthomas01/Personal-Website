Project Overview:
You created a custom-designed acrylic mirror, inspired by a character from Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Instead of buying similar decor online, you chose to design and fabricate it yourself, combining creative design work with hands-on fabrication.

Inspiration:
- Wanted to decorate your room with something personalized and meaningful
- Frequently saw mirrors featuring custom character artwork
- Chose the character "The Gate" from Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood as the design focus

Design & Fabrication Process:
1. Image sourcing: Found high-quality reference images of “The Gate” character online.
2. Design: Used Adobe Illustrator to create a custom vector sketch for laser cutting and engraving.
3. Material: Used a 32" x 20" x 1/8" acrylic sheet.
4. Laser cutting: Ensured proper alignment and balance of the design before sending it to be cut and engraved.
5. Post-processing:
   - Filled the engraved lines with black Sharpie for contrast.
   - Reflected afterward that paint would’ve produced a more professional result.

Outcome & Reflection:
- Successfully created a custom mirror with a unique, stylized look.
- Felt the result was strong for a first-time project, and the design pipeline—from reference image to final product—went smoothly.
- Noted one improvement: using paint instead of Sharpie in future projects for a more polished aesthetic.
